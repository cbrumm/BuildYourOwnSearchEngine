A bunch of code for doing my own little search engine experiments.

Heavily inspired by chapter 4 of the excellent 'Programming Collective
Intelligence' by Toby Segaran (O'Reilly).

This example uses open source software to get the job done:

(1) BeautifulSoup to do the dirtly html parsing.

(2) Pysqlite for storing the index in a relational database on disk.
